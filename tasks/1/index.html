            This page is an overview of the React documentation and related resources.

            React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Learn what React is all about on our homepage or
            in the tutorial.

            Try React
            React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as
            you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a
            complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.

            Online Playgrounds
            If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World
            template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, Glitch, or Stackblitz.

            If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it from
            the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only recommend
            using this for simple demos.

            Add React to a Website
            You can add React to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep
            it contained to a few dynamic widgets.

    <!-- Add React to a Website -->

    <div class="w3-col m6 w3-padding-large" id="add">

            Use as little or as much React as you need.

            React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as
            you need. Perhaps you only want to add some “sprinkles of interactivity” to an existing page. React
            components are a great way to do that.

            The majority of websites aren’t, and don’t need to be, single-page apps. With a few lines of code and no
            build tooling, try React in a small part of your website. You can then either gradually expand its presence,
            or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.

            Add React in One Minute
            Optional: Try React with JSX (no bundler necessary!)
            Add React in One Minute
            In this section, we will show how to add a React component to an existing HTML page. You can follow along
            with your own website, or create an empty HTML file to practice.

            There will be no complicated tools or install requirements — to complete this section, you only need an
            internet connection, and a minute of your time.

            Use an integrated toolchain for the best user and developer experience.

            This page describes a few popular React toolchains which help with tasks like:

            Scaling to many files and components.
            Using third-party libraries from npm.
            Detecting common mistakes early.
            Live-editing CSS and JS in development.
            Optimizing the output for production.
            The toolchains recommended on this page don’t require configuration to get started.

            You Might Not Need a Toolchain
            If you don’t experience the problems described above or don’t feel comfortable using JavaScript tools yet,
            consider adding React as a plain

            This is also the easiest way to integrate React into an existing website. You can always add a larger
            toolchain if you find it helpful!

            Recommended Toolchains
            The React team primarily recommends these solutions:

            If you’re learning React or creating a new single-page app, use Create React App.
            If you’re building a server-rendered website with Node try Next.js
            If you’re building a static content-oriented website, try Gatsby.js
            If you’re building a component library or integrating with an existing codebase, try More Flexible
            Toolchains.

            React relies on a thriving open source community to file bug reports, open pull requests, and submit RFCs.
            To encourage feedback we sometimes share special builds of React that include unreleased features.

            This document will be most relevant to developers who work on frameworks, libraries, or developer tooling.
            Developers who use React primarily to build user-facing applications should not need to worry about our
            prerelease channels.

            How to Read This Guide
            In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you master
            them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.

            Tip

            This guide is designed for people who prefer learning concepts step by step. If you prefer to learn by
            doing, check out our practical tutorial. You might find this guide and the tutorial complementary to each
            other.

            This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of all its
            chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you’re reading this from a mobile device, you can access the
            navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.

            Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters. You can learn most of
            React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar. For example,
            “Introducing JSX” is the next chapter after this one.

            Knowledge Level Assumptions
            React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript
            language. If you don’t feel very confident, we recommend going through a JavaScript tutorial to check your
            knowledge level and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30
            minutes and an hour, but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re learning both React and JavaScript
            at the same time.

            Note

            This guide occasionally uses some of the newer JavaScript syntax in the examples. If you haven’t worked with
            JavaScript in the last few years, these three points should get you most of the way.

            footer.
